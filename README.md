# kucomms
A message transport mechanism between user space and Linux kernel.
A kernel API and a userspace API is provided which allows for asynchronous message passing between a kernel module and a userspace application.
The transport mechanism is similar in concept to Netlink, as it provides a way for userspace and kernel to communicate.
